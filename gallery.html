			<p>The way that Italian farmers turn
			olives into olive oil hasn’t changed
			much since the time of the Romans.
			True, now they use tractors, electric
			rakes and tall metal ladders, but
			each step is still mostly powered by
			manual labor.</p>
			<p><img src="images/oliveharvest-hoist.jpg" alt="Lorenzo Caponetti hoists a bin of olives to the second floor of the Frantoio Rocchi olive mill in Bagnoregio, Viterbo, Italy, where the olives will be weighed and cleaned before being processed into olive oil." class="image-right">
			The 125-acre organic farm at Casa Caponetti
			outside the town of Tuscania in Viterbo, about
			50 miles north of Rome, contains about 500 olive
			trees. Most were planted in the 1950s, and
			will likely live for several hundred years.				
			</p>
			<p>The harvest usually begins near the end of
			October and lasts several weeks. Each tree produces up to 300 pounds of olives each year, and it takes approximately 15-25 pounds of olives to make a liter of olive oil. The olives are
			hand-picked using either electric rakes on extender poles or small handheld rakes.</p>
				
			<p>People come from around the world to help
			with the harvest. Lorenzo Caponetti travels
			around the U.S. making presentations about
			his olive oil and generating interest in his farm
			internships and volunteer opportunities.

			<p>The best oil comes from fresh olives, so each day’s harvest is driven to a mill in the nearby town of Bagnoregio to be processed. When you enter the mill, the first thing you notice is the fine mist of oil that fills the room and fills your lungs.</p>
			<p>“It’s like floating in a fog of olive oil, which is really amazing,” Caponetti says.</p>
			<p>The term “first press” is generally meaningless
			today since these days there is only one
			process of oil extraction. When the pressing
			was done by hand, there would generally be a
			number of pressings, each producing a different
			quality of oil. In those days, “first press”
			meant first among many. The term “virgin”
			means that the olive oil has come from olives
			that have not been pressed before.</p>
			<p>The oil comes out bright green with a peppery,
			fruity flavor. Within weeks the bright
			green oil will begin to turn gold. To keep oil at
			its best, it should be kept away from light, heat
			and oxygen. And, even though it will last several
			years, it’s best in the first year.</p>
